    <h3>Your first index</h3>
    <div>Here's the basic steps you follow to create an index. If you are unsure of how it all works, we'd suggest you create a trial index using the defaults
        and then modify the parameters to get it just how you want.</div>
    <div>If you aren't sure of what a particular setting is, click on the "i" icon, which is displayed next to every field, to open an explanation in a new window</div>
    <ul>
        <li>On the admin menu on the left, go to <em>Indexes</em> and click on <em>Add new</em></li>
        <li>Enter the title of your index and the index slug (the slug will form part of the index's URL)</li>
        <li>Fill in the parameters for the Primary and Secondary indexs, or just use the defaults.
            You can read more about Primary and Secondary indexes <a href="http://support.easyindexplugin.com/support/solutions/articles/6000015597-index-types" target="_blank">here</a></li>
        <li>Underneath the index's main settings, select what it is you want to index</li>
        <li>Once you've entered the index's settings, you should click on "Generate Thumbnails". You can read more about that <a href="http://support.easyindexplugin.com/support/solutions/articles/6000056101-thumbnail-generation" target="_blank">here</a></li>
        <li>You're ready to Publish and view your index!</li>
