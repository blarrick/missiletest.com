/**
 * Class EasyIndexThumbnail
 *
 * EasyIndex's thumbnail class
 *
 * This is a wrapper around ThumbnailBase which adds the capability to find an image source Url from a postID
 * Source images are identified by looking at the post's meta data and if there's nothing there, searching the post for likely images
 *
 * It has the capability to read and store the meta data for an array of postIDs in one SELECT
 * It's much more efficient to do this than to process each post individually. Processing one by one can be a problem on
 * indexes and index widgets where there may be dozens (or even hundreds) of posts to look up
