Wordpress indexes made easy! EasyIndex makes post indexes, recipe indexes, product indexes and more in just minutes. Easy to use, easy to customize.

== Description ==

It's EASY to create an index on your WordPress blog with EasyIndex. It works right out of the box.

Most other index solutions require you to laboriously select and add each category or tag you want to index , or even look up category and post IDs.
With EasyIndex, you just select  the things you want to index from a list and the plugin can create an index almost instantly.

With other index solutions, you are stuck with just one format - EasyIndex has 9 index styles (26 in the Plus version) that you can easily customize with different fonts, colors, text styles and HTML tags.

You can easily add indexes to your menu, and if you want, EasyIndex will automatically make submenu items as required.

And according to our Beta Testers, the link to a relevant help page that's next to every field on the setup screen really made using EasyIndex a breeze.

As well as generating indexes, [EasyIndex Plus](http://easyindexplugin.com) creates customizable sidebar photo galleries  - which you can also embed in posts using a shortcode.

Want a gallery of your latest posts but only include posts from selected categories? EasyIndex Plus can do that with just a few clicks.

Would you like to make a Pinterest style gallery from your posts? If you've got EasyIndex Plus and a spare 30 seconds, you're done!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does EasyIndex work? =

EasyIndex reads all the posts in a selected taxonomy (i.e. categories, tags or other any other grouping your theme or plugins may have defined)
and filters them by terms you select. It automatically scans each post for a suitable image to make a thumbnail from and then displays all the thumbnails grouped by terms, or in an ungrouped gallery</p>

= What does EasyIndex do that WordPress canâ€™t? =

EasyIndex makes it really easy to select exactly what it is you want to index (you don't have to know post or category IDs) and then lets you format your index just the way you want it.

= Can I use EasyIndex "out of the box"? =

Absolutely!

You can create an index in just a few minutes with minimal setup.  All you need to do is click "Add new" index, select what it is you want to index, and hit "Publish". Job done!

There's all sorts of goodies that you can adjust later, but you can create a serviceable index right out of the box.

= How can I customize EasyIndex? =

There are 4 levels of customization in EasyIndex.

First you can decide the style of index you want. EasyIndex has 9 styles you can choose from - EasyIndex Plus has 26 styles, including Pinterest style galleries.

Second, although EasyIndex comes standard with default formatting that will work "out of the box", you can easily change things like HTML tags, fonts and colors used for headings and text.

Third, you can add your own custom CSS if you want extra control.

Finally, [Live Formatting](http://easyindexplugin.com/live-formatting.php) in EasyIndex Plus lets you change almost every CSS style on every index element and you can see the effect of your changes as you make them

= Is it supported? =

We have a [support site](http://support.easyindexplugin.com) where you can read the documentation, view instructional videos and post support tickets.

For EasyIndex Plus users, we'll do our best to answer every support ticket within 24 hours (it may take a little longer on weekends and holidays).

We'll try to get to support tickets from users of the free plugin within a week.
